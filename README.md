Mobile Android API Integration â€“ Java

A mobile (Android) mini-project demonstrating API integration. Developed as part of a Java YH-course, showcasing how to fetch and display data from a REST API in a mobile UI.

Features

- HTTP GET requests to a public or mock API  
- Displays retrieved data in Android UI (RecyclerView or similar)  
- Basic error handling and loading indicators  
- Clean separation between network logic and UI

Technologies Used

- Java  
- Android SDK  
- Retrofit or HttpURLConnection (as used)  
- RecyclerView (or ListView)  
- JSON parsing (Gson or org.json)

How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alexandranimhagen/Mobilt_java23_Alexandra_Nimhagen_API_integration_v4.git
Open the project in Android Studio

Build and run the app on an emulator or device

Ensure internet permission is enabled in AndroidManifest.xml

What I Learned
This project taught me how to:

Integrate REST APIs in mobile apps

Handle network calls and threading in Android
